My name is Bruno Câmara, I live in Seixal, Portugal, I'm married, and father of two sons. My nick is **bfcamara**, which is the name of this blog. Professionally, I am a software developer.

**The Present…**

I work as freelancer focused on Microsoft .Net stack. Since I worked at Microsoft in the Visual Studio Team Services team (Azure DevOps), DevOps is also an area that I am focused on.

**The Recent Past…**

I worked in 2016 at Microsoft as a Software Development Engineer in Visual Studio Team Services / Team Foundation Server team (Azure DevOps).

I worked from 2013 to 2015 as a Freelancer in Visual Studio Team Services / Team Foundation Server related projects.

Before that, I worked at Agilior, a company that I co-founded  in 2004. Agilior was a small consulting services company, and my work was to develop software with Microsoft technology stack.

In 2009 I sold my part of Agilior. As a partner I learned a lot. I made mistakes, but I also have learned too many lessons. I bootstrapped the company with my co-founders, and I had to play many roles: recruitment, financial, marketing, and development. However, my focus was always software development, leading projects in Distributing Systems and Enterprise Application Integration, using technologies such as Microsoft BizTalk, Windows Communication Foundation, NServiceBus, etc. However,  my main goal as a partner was always to build a culture, and a place where people feel good to work. I learned a lot.

**The Past…**

After graduating in computer science in 1999, I started my career at a Portuguese bank, developing the Multi-Channel solution, using technologies such as COM, Sql Server, XSLT, IIS, Javascript, etc.  

**And what else…**

Well, I married when I was 25, in 2001, with my wife Filipa. We have two sons, André, born in 2004, and Filipe, who born in 2007. It has been a awesome journey, and being father it’s not easy. Prepare my sons for life is hard, and I am always questioning myself what is the best to prepare them. My “free” time is almost passed with my sons, playing with them, watching their football training sessions, etc.. When they are sleeping, I read books, follow blogs, and try new technologies.

Finally, I am a Taekwondo and Hapkido student, which helps me to keep my body and
 mental health.
