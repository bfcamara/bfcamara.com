<blockquote class="link_og_blockquote">I'm totally stoked!!! Why? Because I finally get to share Aurelia with the JavaScript world. What is it you might ask? It's a next generation JavaScript client framework unlike anything else available today. Cut to The Chase Several months ago...</blockquote>
<p>I think we were all expecting this announcement from Rob Eisenberg after he had announced in November last year that <a href="http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/leaving-angular/" target="_blank">he was leaving Angular 2.0</a>. <a href="http://aurelia.io/" target="_blank">Aurelia</a> is the new JavaScript client framework. I watched the <a href="http://vimeo.com/117778145" target="_blank">video</a>, and it looks really good. The comparisons to Angular are inevitable, at least for me, because Angular is my framework of choice to develop rich web applications.</p>
<p><strong>I'm very curious to check how the community will embrace Aurelia</strong>. I believe that Aurelia is arriving at the right moment after all the controversy about Angular 2.0. It seems obvious that those developers not very happy with the future of Angular 2.0, will embrace Aurelia (or at lest they will try it for sure). Let's start to check Aurelia in Google Search Trends.&nbsp;</p>
