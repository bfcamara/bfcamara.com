There are some ideas on the book that make me say that it's a worth reading, however I am skeptical about some of them. There is no doubt that the guy is a great marketer, which can be checked by the book title itself</span></div>

<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>When I first saw the book &nbsp;I thought "here we have another quick rich scheme scam" of the millions that exists on the internet. However the book was recommended by a friend of mine, and then I "took the shot". Since the average customer review on the Amazon is also very high, why not buy the book and read it. That's what I did. And as I said, it is a worth reading, and not a scam at all. The book title is exaggerated, but is a great title in a marketing point of view.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>In this book I had contact with a great and inspirational story of the Mexican Fisherman. Here is the Story</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal&nbsp;</span><span>Mexican village on doctor's orders. Unable to sleep after an&nbsp;</span><span>urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to&nbsp;</span><span>the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had&nbsp;</span><span>docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The&nbsp;</span><span>American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "How long did it take you to catch them?" the American asked.</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Only a little while," the Mexican replied in surprisingly good&nbsp;</span><span>English.</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?" the American&nbsp;</span><span>then asked.</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,"&nbsp;</span><span>the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "But... What do you do with the rest of your time?"</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Mexican looked up and smiled. "I sleep late, fish a little, play&nbsp;</span><span>with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the&nbsp;</span><span>village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my&nbsp;</span><span>amigos. I have a full and busy life, senor."</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The American laughed and stood tall. "Sir, I'm a Harvard M.B.A.&nbsp;</span><span>and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the&nbsp;</span><span>proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats&nbsp;</span><span>with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing&nbsp;</span><span>boats."</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; He continued, "Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you&nbsp;</span><span>would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own&nbsp;</span><span>cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution.&nbsp;</span><span>You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course,&nbsp;</span><span>and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New&nbsp;</span><span>York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with&nbsp;</span><span>proper management."</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Mexican fisherman asked, "But, se&ntilde;or, how long will all this&nbsp;</span><span>take?"</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; To which the American replied, "15-20 years. 25 tops."</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "But what then, se&ntilde;or?"</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The American laughed and said, "That's the best part. When the&nbsp;</span><span>time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company&nbsp;</span><span>stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions."</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Millions, senor? Then what?"</span></em></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><em><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village,&nbsp;</span><span>where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids,&nbsp;</span><span>take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evening&nbsp;</span><span>where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.</span></em></blockquote>

<div><span>I don't know who the author is, but this story had a profound impact on my feelings. Why? <strong>Because in the past I thought as the businessman, that I would need to be rich to have the freedom of how I would spend my time.</strong> In one of my previous posts I explained <a href="http://bfcamara.com/post/17149497531/my-first-big-mistake-as-founder" title="my big mistake as founder" target="_self">my big mistake as a founder</a> which reflects this kind of thinking. <strong>Now I think like the Fisherman, and it's the road that I want to follow.&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
