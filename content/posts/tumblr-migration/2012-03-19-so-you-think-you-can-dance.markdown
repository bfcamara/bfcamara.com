description: "So you think you can dance?"
---
<p><span>Don't be fooled by the title, since I don&rsquo;t have any dancing skills and probably never will. In fact my wife always said me that I am a lousy dancer. Her feet always suffer when we dance together.</span></p>
<p><span>The real question I want to ask is:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><strong>Do you think you can leave your day job and start your own company?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>During my life, I&rsquo;ve listen too many persons criticizing the company partners/directors, about some of the option behind made, or about some policies, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>It's legitimate, nobody is above critic. I also criticize some options. What makes me uncomfortable is listen sentences such as</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>"If I had my own company I..."</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>My question &nbsp;is immediately: </span><em>&ldquo;So, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</em><span> or </span><em>"So you think you can leave your day job and start your own company?"</em></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Let me show you a chart</span></p>
<div></div>
<div><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.680594107368961"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="296" data-orig-width="489" data-orig-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L693TQBAGOwS0-bkwxIjn3tSWoOntem8b3oPTIderRcd0swWz8ebhpv8gp0Am0jg5n4W2lAGot1Hs6PHBu3RiOL5aJ9GXSW1Jv4iXtkQJYhcCuoaiaU"><img height="296px;" src="./156da5aecddea23b14e7af4b2643a1f6898584ebfdee26f738826b34a0ff12ae.jpg" width="489px;" data-orig-height="296" data-orig-width="489" data-orig-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L693TQBAGOwS0-bkwxIjn3tSWoOntem8b3oPTIderRcd0swWz8ebhpv8gp0Am0jg5n4W2lAGot1Hs6PHBu3RiOL5aJ9GXSW1Jv4iXtkQJYhcCuoaiaU"></figure></strong></div>

<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>This chart shows my asset values (house mortgage not accounted for). <strong>The inflection point, at January of 2004, is when I left my job and started my own company.</strong> There were many fringe benefits that I&rsquo;ve lost, such as car, fuel allowance, mobile phone, stock options, tuition, etc. Some of these perks, I had to buy/pay myself after leaving my job. </span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span> <strong>So you think you can handle this?</strong> </span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>I think it will be interest to analyze the typical answers, <em>&ldquo;I have a mortgage to pay&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;I have kids and I need some security&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;I want to guarantee my retire plan&rdquo;</em>, but maybe in a future post. </span></div>

<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>P.S. I don&rsquo;t intend to discourage anyone, but if you are doing the talk, you have at least be (seriously) willing to do the walk.</span></div>
