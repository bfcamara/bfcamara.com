<p><a href="http://www.uibox.in/" target="_blank">UIBox</a> - it seems to me a very good initiative. Almost any Web UI component that we can think of has already been built by someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A search on Google results in hundreds of results. All this is great!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except for a few problems: no demos, poor documentation, dependencies conflicts, browser support, etc.</p>
<p><span>The UIBox initiative tries to help solving this problems. To start with, UIBox is a curated HTML, CSS, JS UI component library.&nbsp;</span><span>There are a few requirements to a given component be present in UIBox:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>must have a working demo page</span></li>
<li><span>must be well documented</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
