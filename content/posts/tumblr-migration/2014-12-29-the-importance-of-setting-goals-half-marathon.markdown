<p><span>We are at that time of the year when people typically do a retrospective on how good/bad was the year that is ending. Well, I'm not writing this post to do that kind of reflection, instead I want to show <strong>how important is to set goals in our lives</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Last Dec. 7, <strong>I finished my first half-marathon, 21 Km (13.1 miles), in 2 hours and 7 minutes.</strong></span></p>

<p>I would like to write this post telling you how strong I've cut the finish line, but the truth is that it was very hard, particularly the final 3 kilometers. I confess that I spent many minutes thinking to quit, and how absurd I was being in craving for this goal, especially when I don't take any pleasure in running. Let me explain why I did it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bfcamara.com/post/33154883793/im-back-with-a-fixed-heart" target="_blank">In June of 2012 I did a surgery to my heart</a>. Before the surgery I had strong limitations which didn't allow me to practice sports. With the aorta aneurysm already removed and an aortic prosthesis placed in my heart, a few months later, my surgeon told me that I was ready to do what I want freely except weight lifting. To be honest, I didn't believe him 100%. I decided to make some tests. So, <strong>In 2013 I set the following goals for me:</strong></p>
<ol><li><span>By the end of 2013 I'll run <strong>10 Km</strong>. Nice to have: complete it less than an hour</span></li>
<li><span></span>By the end of 2014 I'll run a &nbsp;<strong>half-marathon</strong> (21 Km). Nice to have: complete it less than 2 hours</li>
<li>By the end of 2015 I'll run a <strong>marathon</strong> (42 Km). Nice to have: complete it less than 4 hours.</li>
</ol><p>So, I started running in 2013. I was very excited, I bought some shoes, I started to train during the morning, etc. After 2 weeks, I had to stop because my knees couldn't support all this kind of effort (I weighed &nbsp;to much by that time). I stopped for 2 weeks, and then I started gradually. And <strong>here are the results:</strong></p>
<ol><li><span>I achieved the first goal very well: <strong>by the end of 2013 I run 10Km in 52 minutes.</strong></span></li>
<li><span></span>The 2nd goal was achieved as well, <strong>I run a half-marathon by the end of 2014, however I took 2 hours and 7 minutes to complete it</strong> . So, I'd say that I completed the goal.</li>
</ol><p>But when I was cutting the finish line, <strong>my first thought was: "hey Bruno, do you think you could handle to run more 21 Kms?". My answer was a big "NO"</strong>. I have now many doubts if I should go with the 3rd goal at all. It is a lot of pain. <strong>It's not just the pain on the day you run a marathon. It's all the pain of the training sessions. Currently. I'm not prepared to run a marathon</strong>. In fact I'm wondering if I should drop the goal at all.</p>
<p><strong>The moral of this all story is that if I hadn't set any goal I wouldn't even run 10 KMs. I'm sure about that. This last 3 months, every Sunday, I woke up to run to be prepared to the half-marathon. And the only thought that I had in my mind was "I have to achieve my goal"</strong>.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, it's the goals theirselves that allows us to understand if a goal is realistic or not. And that's why I'm really evaluating if I'll run a marathon or not.</span></p>
<p><span>Happy new year 2015.</span></p>
