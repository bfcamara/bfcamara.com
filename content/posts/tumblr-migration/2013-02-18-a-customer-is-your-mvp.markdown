<p>Great session from <a href="http://unicornfree.com" title="Amy Hoy - Unicorn Free" target="_blank">Amy Hoy</a>, where she talks on making products that sell. Her advice: don't look for an idea. Look for an audience; understand and know your audience; kill a pain of your audience with a unique selling proposition (USP).&nbsp;</p>
