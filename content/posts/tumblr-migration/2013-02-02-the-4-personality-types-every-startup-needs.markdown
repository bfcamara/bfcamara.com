<p>A great post from Dharmesh Shah, on <a href="http://onstartups.com" title="OnStartups " target="_blank">OnStartups</a>, where &nbsp;he identifies the 4 most important startup personalities to build an unbeatable team:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Beast (The X-men), who has a "get shid done" mentality</li>
<li>Lara Croft, with an adventurer and entrepreneurial spirit</li>
<li>The Architect (the character from the Matrix), who understands the big picture and can still focus on the details.</li>
<li>The Most Interesting Man in the World, with character, charm, and adds depth to the company culture.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Worth reading.</p>
