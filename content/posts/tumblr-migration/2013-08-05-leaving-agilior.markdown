Nine and half years after I have founded Agilior, at 4 January 2004, today it ends a cycle in my life. As most of you already know, because you know me personally or have read my post "<a href="http://www.bfcamara.com/post/17149497531/my-first-big-mistake-as-founder" target="_blank">My First Big Mistake as a Founder</a>", I already have not any shares of the company, and currently &nbsp;I was just an employee.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>This way out was expected for some time due the fact that Agilior, in the present moment, could not give me the professional achievement that I need</strong>. Hence I'm feeling with a mix of feelings of happiness and nostalgy. Happiness because this way out it is something that I already wanted some time ago, but I have not had &nbsp;the courage to do it. Nostalgy because I look back and <strong>I remember great moments that I lived at Agilior, in particular the times that I helped to grow a company</strong> which started with 3 people, becoming in a company with 9 people. I've had a great pleasure to work with these people, building software development projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, I'm finishing now a stage in my life, and in this moment I<strong> need some time to think and reflect about what to do next, and decide what way to follow</strong>. I will take off some vacations on August with total dedication to the family, and avoiding being online.</p>
