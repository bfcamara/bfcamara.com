<blockquote class="link_og_blockquote"><span>I believe that your seniority and value as a programmer is measured not in what you know, it&rsquo;s measured in what you put out. The two are related but definitely not the same. Your value is in how you move your project forward and how you empower your team to do the same.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>
<p>Worth reading. Great post.</p>
